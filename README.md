### Who am I?:thinking:

My name is Daniel:wave:, I'm from Madrid, Spain and I started my journey to become a Data Engineer in 2022. I was always attracted to both art and programming, so after a time I decided to give a chance to this fantastic field which I actually enjoy every day.

I had the opportunity of being part of the program ["Hackea tu futuro"](https://www.hackeatufuturo.es/) imparted by The Valley with the collaboration of Barrabes.biz and Red.es. We learnt about Big Data, what roles do the field offers, which techniques and technologies are being used and much more.

### But you may be wondering what I do here in my GitHub, so let's dive in:writing_hand:.

**Currently I have 2 main repositories active:**

- [GW2-SRS](https://github.com/icharo-tb/GW2_SRS)
    ---
    - This is my main serious project repository. GW2-SRS is a system to study raid results, both kills and defeats, in order to understand which classes in the game are better for each boss. I have the idea of finishing this project with a Machine Learning algorithm that could recommend a new player which class he/she should build, based on the player preferences. Now the project comprehends more than that, all the information can be founded on the README file in the repository.

- [Git Practice](https://github.com/icharo-tb/Git_practice)
    ---
    - In this repository, I wanted to embrace and include every exercise and study I do around Data Engineering topics. It is focused on Python as the main coding language, although there are also mongodb code and some other surprises you should find by exploring the repository. Everything is explained in the README file as well.
